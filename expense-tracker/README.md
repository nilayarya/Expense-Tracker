## Introduction

Built Expense Budget Tracker in ReactJs. Used State Management in React, Context API, Local Storage, Material UI. I have used a scalable React folder structure for simple understanding. I have given the app voice capabilities made possible using speechly.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
